# Debris-Flow-Automatic-Annotation-Dataset
The debris flow dataset was automatically annotated using the automatic annotation algorithm proposed by myself. As a result, there may be discrepancies in accuracy compared to manual annotations. The dataset also includes unannotated data, which is available for manual annotation by others.
